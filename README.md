# Photogrammetry_Image_and_Camera_Calibration
## You can modified the program to finish image calibration, remove lens distortion
### Before using this program, you should calculate your own calibration coefficients with Metashape, Australis or anyother related method.
* Download folder "hw3" and file "HW3.sln".
* Modified the calibration coefficient in Main Code.
* Conduct calibration, the program has progress bar and let you know processing speed.
* When it's done, the lens disortion of your image will be removed.

noted: the images in photo/test are examples that you can use in software, such as Australis, to calculate calibration coefficients.
